📊 Project: Student Percentage Prediction using Supervised ML 🎯

Are you curious about the correlation between study hours and academic performance? Look no further! In this project, I undertook a captivating journey into the world of data analysis and predictive modeling.

🔹 Objective: The main goal of this project was to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours invested. By employing Supervised Machine Learning, I aimed to uncover the relationship between these two vital variables.

🔍 Approach: With a simple linear regression task at hand, I explored the dataset, performed data preprocessing, and carefully selected appropriate features. Leveraging the power of Python and libraries like scikit-learn, I built a predictive model that could accurately estimate a student's percentage based on their study hours.

📈 Key Highlights:

Data Exploration: Conducted in-depth data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of study hours and corresponding percentages.

Model Development: Employed a simple linear regression algorithm to create a predictive model that learns from the data patterns and establishes a linear relationship.

Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using various evaluation metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

💡 Impact: This project holds immense significance as it not only sheds light on the vital connection between study hours and academic performance but also lays the groundwork for potential interventions to improve student outcomes.

🔭 Future Scope: With the success of this project, I'm excited about exploring more complex machine learning models and incorporating additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.

Join me in celebrating the power of data-driven insights and predictive modeling in shaping a brighter educational landscape! 🎓🌟
